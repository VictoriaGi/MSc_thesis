```{r}
med
```

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(tidyverse)
med %>% select(Order, Family, Genustotal, Currentname) %>% 
  group_by(Order, Family, Genustotal) %>% 
  summarize( N = n())
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
